					<li>
						<span class="bg-cyan">Never</span> limit your color scheme. Use all the colors. <span class="bg-lime">All</span> <span class="bg-pink">of</span> <span class="bg-yell">them</span>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="font-impact">More</span> <strong class="font-papyrus">fonts</strong> = <span class="font-comic-sans">better</span>.
					</li>
					<li>There's nothing wrong with tiny fonts. Weed out the people who don't care enough to squint and strain their eyes. They just <sub>aren't <sub>dedicated <sub>enough.</sub></sub></sub></li>
					<li>Sometimes, the cruelest thing you can give a client is exactly what they want.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Prosperity</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you want people to buy more stuff from your shop, <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/optimistjenna/shop">just link to it more.</a> 
						Use <a title="Inclusion Matters bag" href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/tote-bag/Inclusion-Matters-by-optimistjenna/89998346.P1QBH">lots</a> of <a title="Give Me Space shirt" href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/t-shirt/Give-Me-Space-by-optimistjenna/88586469.0S66D">links</a> to <a title="neurodiversity symbol sticker" href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/sticker/Neurodiversity-Symbol-Light-by-optimistjenna/88190815.EJUG5">different</a> <a title="cute colorful laptop case" href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/laptop-case/Bright-Color-Block-by-optimistjenna/89087055.2U5KG">products</a>. 
						People will subconsciously want to buy everything.
					</li>
					<li>Some people like to do a "grindset" but it is also inappropriate to grind your bones into dust, so keep that in mind. You need your bones for later.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Life</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>When life gives you lemons, <span class="bg-yell">crush them with your bare hands.</span> Show it the results of your workouts. This will intimidate/enamor life into giving you its highest-quality fruit.</li>
					<li>If you don't understand something, just collect as many numbers about it as you possibly can.</li>
					<li>The trick for never being ashamed for taking a break is to be utterly shameless. Yeah, maybe I'm a potato sometimes. What are you gonna do about it?</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>And here's the biggest secret of all...</h3>
				<p>The meaning of life is <span class="font-comic-sans">variable</span>. Earlier, it was <span id="pastMeaning" class="bg-cyan">hugs</span>. Now, it's <span id="currentMeaning" class="bg-pink">chocolate cake</span>.</p>
				<p>Tomorrow, it's your turn to choose the meaning of life, so make it a good one.</p>

				<br/>
				<button onclick="changeMeaningsOfLife(false)">Check if the meaning of life has changed yet</button>
				<br/><br/>
				<p id="noChange" style="display:none;">The meaning of life has not changed yet. Go make the most of it while you can.</p>
