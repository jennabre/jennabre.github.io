				<h1>About Me</h1>

				<img class="float-right" src="pics/waving-202209.gif" alt="">

				<p>I am a developer, thinker, designer, drawer, writer, blogger, eater, breather, and word-er who has five million hobbies, which I should probably list in painstaking detail because I am <span class="font-comic-sans"><u>certain</u></span> you want to know each one.</p>
				<p>If you want to contact me, you may do so telepathically.</p>
				
				<h2>Useless facts about me</h2>
				
				<ul>
					<li>As you may have noticed, I love bright and cheerful colors.</li>
					<li>I can type about 90-100 wpm under normal circumstances and about 70 wpm when one of my fingers is unusable because I tried to save the bees with my bare hands.</li>
					<li>My useless skills include doing calculus in my sleep and putting my foot on my own head.</li>
					<li>This website is the type of thing that happens when I am left unsupervised.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Precise Skill Levels (Super Accurate)</h2>
