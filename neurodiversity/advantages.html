				<br/>

				<p>
					Many employers don't see the value of neurodivergent and disabled workers. They see differences as potential liabilities without understanding that often, <a href="https://www.optimistjenna.com/value-disabled-workers/">the strengths outweigh the needs</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thinking and experiencing the world differently isn't always a bad thing. In fact, sometimes it helps people solve problems and develop unique strengths.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here's a breakdown of common strengths in people with different disabilities.
				</p>
				
				<h2>ADHD</h2>
				<p>
					Many people know that people with ADHD often struggle to focus. Fewer people know about hyperfocus, an extreme state of focus that can occur when a person with ADHD becomes absorbed in a task.
				</p>
				<p>
					Other strengths associated with ADHD include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-creativity-of-adhd/">Creativity</a></li>
					<li>Problem-solving</li>
					<li>Calm under pressure</li>
					<li>Generosity</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Autism</h2>
				<p>
					While many people have heard stories of autistic savants or STEM wizards, the reality is that autistic people are a diverse group with a range of skills.
				</p>
				<p>
					Common advantages of autistic brains include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Systems thinking</li>
					<li>Detail orientation</li>
					<li>Out-of-the-box thinking</li>
					<li>Clear written communication</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Dyslexia</h2>
				<p>
					While dyslexia is traditionally thought of as a weakness, this doesn't explain the relatively high percentage of CEOs with the condition.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of the <a href="https://www.dyslexiasupportsouth.org.nz/parent-toolkit/emotional-impact/strengths-of-dyslexia/">strengths related to dyslexia</a> may come directly from being neurodivergent. A brain that works differently is likely to be above-average in some situations, after all. But others may come from life lessons related to struggling with reading. When you work harder, you learn more.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Superior work ethic</li>
					<li>Creativity</li>
					<li>Problem-solving skills</li>
					<li>Noticing what's out of place</li>
					<li>Empathy</li>
					<li>Narrative reasoning and storytelling (Have you noticed how many dyslexic authors there are?)</li>
				</ul>
