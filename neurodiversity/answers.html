				<h1>Quiz: Correct Answers</h1>
				
				<h2>Question 1</h2>
				<div class="colorbox">
					During a meeting, my colleague starts rocking back and forth while staring into space. 
					That means she's
					<ul>
						<li>a: Not listening</li>
						<li>b: Being rude</li>
						<li><b>c: Paying attention in her own way</b></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					Sitting still can be unnatural to some people. 
					While looking away can be a sign of inattention in neurotypicals, 
					some neurodivergent people find listening easier if they don't have to look at you.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Her behavior is an example of perfectly normal 
					<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Interpret-Autistic-Body-Language">autistic body language</a>. 
					(In fact, it suggests that she's listening intently.)
				</p>
				
				<br/>
				
				<h2>Question 2</h2>
				<div class="colorbox">
					My coworker says he can't focus in an open office. 
					I'll suggest that he
					<ul>
						<li><b>a: Explain the issue and ask for his own office</b></li>
						<li>b: Stop complaining and deal with it</li>
						<li>c: Wear headphones</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					Wearing headphones is a good idea, but it may not drown out everything. 
					Open offices are hard for many people. 
					For people with sensory issues, they may be impossible to handle.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Neurodivergent people may understate the degree of their struggles 
					for fear of being perceived as "difficult." 
					It's possible that your coworker is struggling more than he lets on.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Your coworker might have 
					<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Diagnose-Sensory-Processing-Disorder">sensory processing disorder</a>. 
					Accommodations can help him focus better.
				</p>
				
				<br/>
				
				<h2>Question 1</h2>
				<div class="colorbox">
					The autistic programmer I supervise is covering her ears. 
					She looks like she might cry.
					<ul>
						<li><b>a: Suggest that she take a break or work from home today</b></li>
						<li>b: Ignore it</li>
						<li>c: Distract her with conversation about the work</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					This programmer is experiencing sensory overload and is at risk for an autistic meltdown or shutdown. 
					She needs a break and time to recover.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Unfortunately, some autistic people struggle with assertiveness skills, 
					so she may try to "tough it out" if she thinks she has to. 
					Telling her she can take a break will encourage her to take initiative in the future.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Since her problem is overwhelm, trying to distract her (however well-meaning) 
					will only worsen her stress. 
					Help her escape and then let her be for a while.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Confused? Try learning about 
					<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Reduce-Sensory-Overload">sensory overload</a> and 
					<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Handle-an-Autistic-Friend%27s-Meltdown">autistic meltdowns</a>.

				<h2>Question 1</h2>
				<div class="colorbox">
					My coworker with Down syndrome has a speech impediment. 
					It'll help him if I
					<ul>
						<li>a: Mimic it so that he'll understand better</li>
						<li><b>b: Talk normally; he'll tell me if he needs something else</b></li>
						<li>c: Speak very slowly and loudly so he can process</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					Mimicking his speech impediment won't help him understand, 
					nor will speaking loudly or slowly. 
					(He may think you're being rude.) 
					People with intellectual disabilities usually understand normal speech just fine. 
					If he needs you to slow down or speak up, he'll probably tell you.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Here's more info on best practices when 
					<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Talk-to-Someone-with-an-Intellectual-Disability">talking to someone with an intellectual disability</a>.

				<h2>Question 1</h2>
				<div class="colorbox">
					My teammate with ADHD talks so fast I can't understand! 
					I should
					<ul>
						<li>a: Try harder to listen</li>
						<li>b: Drop hints to avoid hurting her feelings</li>
						<li><b>c: Politely ask her to slow down so I can keep up</b></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					It's okay to make space for your own needs when talking to a person with a disability.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					She probably has no idea she's going too fast for you. 
					Be polite and direct to make sure she gets it. 
					Try saying, "Hey, I can't keep up. Could you slow down a little?"
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Here's more info on how to

				<h2>Question 1</h2>
				<div class="colorbox">
					My coworker monopolizes the conversation with obscure astronomy facts. 
					The best way to handle it is probably to
					<ul>
						<li><b>a: Tell him I'd like to talk about something else or say I've got to go</b></li>
						<li>b: Avoid him whenever possible and talk with my coworkers about handling him</li>
						<li>c: Tolerate it until I get frustrated and tell him to shut up</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<p>
					Your coworker is probably oblivious to the fact he's taking over the conversation. 
					Avoiding or tolerating him won't improve your relationship. 
					Being polite or direct can clue him in to what you want.
