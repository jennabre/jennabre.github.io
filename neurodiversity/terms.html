				<h1>Neurodiversity terminology</h1>
			
				<p>
					How do you talk about neurodiversity? 
					Here's some general information.
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b>Disability</b>: A variation in ability not accommodated by society</li>
					<li><b>Neurodivergent</b>: Someone with a brain-based disability or mental illness</li>
					<li><b>Neurodiversity</b>: The natural diversity of human brains</li>
					<li><b>Neurotypical</b>: Someone with a "neurologically typical" brain, lacking any disabilities</li>
					<li><b>Social model of disability</b>: The idea that disability is caused by society's failure to accommodate a difference in ability</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Person first or identity first?</h2>

				<p>
					Some people believe in saying "person with X." 
					This is a way to say "I am more than my disability/illness."
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Other people believe in saying "X person." 
					This is a way to say "There is nothing bad about who I am."
				</p>
				
				<table>
					<caption>Person-First and Identity-First Language</caption>
					<tr>
						<th>Person First</th>
						<th>Identity First</th>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Person with a disability</td>
						<td>Disabled person</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Woman with Down syndrome</td>
						<td>Down syndrome woman</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Adult with autism</td>
						<td>Autistic adult</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Kids with ADHD</td>
						<td>ADHD kids</td>
					</tr>
					
					<tr>
						<td>Man with anxiety</td>
						<td>Anxious man</td>
					</tr>
				
				
				</table>
				
				<p>
					You may have seen campaigns urging you to "always put the person first!" 
					But <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Write-About-Disability">according to wikiHow</a>, it's a little more complicated than that.
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>Americans often prefer person-first language. Brits often prefer identity-first language.</li>
					<li>People with developmental disabilities usually prefer person-first language. 
					Autistics often strongly prefer identity-first language.</li>
					<li>People who see their condition as an illness or impediment usually prefer person-first language. 
					People who see their condition as part of their identity often prefer identity-first language.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>If there is no clear community preference, a mix of both will suffice.</p>
