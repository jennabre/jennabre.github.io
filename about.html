				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					I'm a new graduate from ASU. 
					When I'm not tinkering with code, I enjoy doodling, trying to beat my fastest Rubik's cube time, playing piano, and spending time with my family.
				</p>
				
				
				<h2>Useful facts about me</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I have been writing code since I was about 14 years old.</li>
					<li>I'm interested in design, user experience, and usability.</li>
					<li>I am certified to run experiments on human subjects and I have experience running usability tests.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Useless facts about me</h2>
				
				<ul>
					<li>As you may have noticed, I love bright and cheerful colors.</li>
					<li>I can type about 90-100 wpm under normal circumstances and about 70 wpm when one of my fingers is unusable because I tried to save the bees with my bare hands.</li>
					<li>My useless skills include doing calculus in my sleep and putting my foot on my own head.</li>
					<li>This website is the type of thing that happens when I am left unsupervised.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Should you hire me?</h2>
				<p>Prospective employers may be looking at this portfolio wondering if I'm worth hiring.</p>
				
				<p>If you're on the fence, I can offer some illuminating insights on whether it would be a good decision.</p>
