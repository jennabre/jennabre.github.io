				<h1>Dog Ownership Readiness Quiz Answers</h1>
				<p>
					How well did you do? 
					Check your answers and learn more about dog care.
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<form>
				
					<p>
						1. You are baking cookies when a chocolate chip falls onto the floor. 
						Before you can pick it up, a large yellow lab runs over and eats the chocolate chip. 
						You...
					</p>
						
					<ul class="answers">
						<li class="wrong">Rush the dog to the vet</li>
						<li class="wrong">Yell at the dog until it gets scared</li>
						<li class="correct">Move the bag farther from the edge and continue baking</li>
						<li class="wrong">Feed the dog more chocolate</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						A single chocolate chip is unlikely to do any real harm to a big dog. 
						This is a tiny mistake, and not worth worrying over.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						2. You're making a salad, and your dog begs for food. 
						What would be OK to give your dog?
					</p>
					
					<ul class="answers">
						<li class="correct">Spinach</li>
						<li class="correct">Carrots</li>
						<li class="wrong">Macadamia nuts</li>
						<li class="correct">Cucumbers</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						Spinach, carrots, and cucumbers are healthy for dogs. 
						Macadamia nuts are toxic to dogs.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						3. Which of these things should you do first in the morning?
					</p>
					
					<ul class="answers">
						<li class="correct">Take the dog out</li>
						<li class="wrong">Feed the dog</li>
						<li class="wrong">Get yourself ready for the day</li>
						<li class="wrong">Check your phone</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						After a long night indoors, dogs need to stretch their legs and relieve themselves. 
						Handle your usual routine after letting out the dog.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						4. Do dogs typically thrive on a vegetarian diet?
					</p>
					
					<ul class="answers">
						<li class="wrong">Yes</li>
						<li class="correct">No</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						It is very hard to keep a dog healthy on a vegetarian diet. 
						Vegetarian dogs may experience health complications such as seizures.
						While many vegetables are good for dogs, dogs are healthiest when they eat meat too.
						
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want a vegan or vegetarian pet, try a rabbit, or a rodent such as a hamster or gerbil.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						5. How much guacamole can you give your dog?
					</p>
					
					<ul class="answers">
						<li class="wrong">Plenty</li>
						<li class="wrong">Just a little</li>
						<li class="correct">None</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						Avocado is toxic to dogs, so your dog should not eat guacamole.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						6. Can you let your dog off its leash in any field?
					</p>
					
					<ul class="answers">
						<li class="wrong">Yes</li>
						<li class="correct">No</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						There are two things you need to consider: safety and rules.
						Snakes, broken glass, and busy streets could pose a hazard to dogs. 
						(Don't assume that your dog will know better than to run into traffic, especially if they're chasing something.) 
						Some places have signs posted stating that dogs must stay on leashes. 
						Stick to familiar, safe places if you're going to take your dog off-leash.
					</p>
				
				</form>

				<h2>Considering your score</h2>
				<p>
					Don't worry if you got a few wrong answers. 
					That just means you need to learn more about dog health and safety.
