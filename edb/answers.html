				<h1>Dog Ownership Readiness Quiz Answers</h1>
				<p>How well did you do? Check your answers and learn more about dog care.</p>
				<br>
				
				<form>
				
					<p>1. You are baking cookies when a chocolate chip falls onto the floor. Before you can pick it up, a large yellow lab runs over and eats the chocolate chip. You...</p>
						
					<ul class="answers">
						<li class="wrong">Rush the dog to the vet</li>
						<li class="wrong">Yell at the dog until it gets scared</li>
						<li class="correct">Move the bag farther from the edge and continue baking</li>
						<li class="wrong">Feed the dog more chocolate</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>A single chocolate chip is unlikely to do any real harm to a big dog. This is a tiny mistake and you don't need to worry about it.</p>
					
					<p>2. You're making a salad, and your dog begs for food. What would be OK to give your dog?</p>
					
					<ul class="answers">
						<li class="correct">Spinach</li>
						<li class="correct">Carrots</li>
						<li class="wrong">Macadamia nuts</li>
						<li class="correct">Cucumbers</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Spinach, carrots, and cucumbers are healthy for dogs. But macadamia nuts are poisonous to them.</p>
					
					<p>3. Which of these things should you do first in the morning?</p>
					
					<ul class="answers">
						<li class="correct">Take the dog out</li>
						<li class="wrong">Feed the dog</li>
						<li class="wrong">Get yourself ready for the day</li>
						<li class="wrong">Check your phone</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>After a long night indoors, dogs need to stretch their legs and relieve themselves. Handle your usual routine after letting out the dog.</p>
					
					<p>4. Do dogs typically thrive on a vegetarian diet?</p>
					
					<ul class="answers">
						<li class="wrong">Yes</li>
						<li class="correct">No</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						It is very hard to keep a dog healthy on a vegetarian diet. Vegetarian dogs may experience health complications such as seizures. While many vegetables are good for dogs, dogs are healthiest when they eat meat too.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want a vegan or vegetarian pet, try a rabbit or a rodent such as a hamster or gerbil.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						5. How much guacamole can you give your dog?
					</p>
					
					<ul class="answers">
						<li class="wrong">Plenty</li>
						<li class="wrong">Just a little</li>
						<li class="correct">None</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Avocado is toxic to dogs, so your dog should not eat guacamole.</p>
					
					<p>6. Can you let your dog off its leash in any field?</p>
					
					<ul class="answers">
						<li class="wrong">Yes</li>
						<li class="correct">No</li>
					</ul>

					<p>There are several things you need to consider before letting your dog off leash:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Environment safety:</strong> Are there snakes, broken glass, or busy streets nearby?</li>
						<li><strong>Prey drive:</strong> Does your dog like to chase local animals? They may run into the street or woods.</li>
						<li><strong>Recall and training:</strong> How well-trained is your dog right now? If you say "come" or "leave it," will they listen (even with interesting distractions)?</li>
						<li><strong>Strangers:</strong> Some people are scared of dogs. They may feel scared or react badly if your dog is off leash. Be cautious around people you don't know.</li>
						<li><strong>Rules:</strong> Obey signs and local laws.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>Stick to familiar, safe places if you're going to take your dog off leash. Using a long lead may also be a good option if you want to give your dog more freedom while keeping them safe.</p>
				
				</form>

				<h2>Considering your score</h2>
				<p>Don't worry if you got a few wrong answers. That just means you need to learn more about dog health and safety.</p>
